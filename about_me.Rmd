I am currently finishing up last semester my Master's program at Tufts University while working full-time as a BI Analyst at a healthcare center. 
Outside of work, I find joy in hiking, watching sunsets, and cooking food. I'm all about embracing life's adventures, whether it's hiking through nature's wonders or discovering hidden coffee gems.
