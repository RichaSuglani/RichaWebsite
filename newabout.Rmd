title: "About me"
description: |
      Hi my name is Richa Suglani. I’m currently finishing up my master’s program at Tufts university. I also work a full time job as a BI Analyst at a healthcare center. Outside of work I enjoy hiking, watching sunsets and cooking food. I’m all about embracing life's adventures, whether it's hiking through nature's wonders or discovering hidden coffee gems.
